# iSeeICE_app

Due to the current political state of the world that of which we live in, I took it upon myself to build a forum-style application, powered by Softr (an Airtable company) to allow users to users report I.C.E. sightings in their area. Using pre-set filters, users are able to view the latest news and stay up-to-date for the safety and security of not just themseleves, but their loved ones.

**Here is the general layout of the web version of the application.** Users also have the option to view the application on a mobile device.

<br/>

on mobile devices, you will be prompted to "download" the app by selecting the iOS APP STORE icon on the bottom right corner. As of June 2025, this application is not available on the app store. However, you can bookmark the link to the online version of the app and save it to your mobile device's Home Screen. This will make it look like an installed app.
