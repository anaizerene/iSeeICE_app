# iSeeICE_app

Due to the current political state of the world that of which we live in, I took it upon myself to build a forum-style application, powered by Softr (an Airtable company) to allow users to users report I.C.E. sightings in their area. Using pre-set filters, users are able to view the latest news and stay up-to-date for the safety and security of not just themseleves, but their loved ones.
